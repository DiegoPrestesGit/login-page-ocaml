> Learning this beautiful functional language

- I'm learning from the book [OCaml from the very beginning](https://www.amazon.com.br/Ocaml-Very-Beginning-John-Whitington/dp/0957671105), it's the best source of knowledge for someone who doesn't know a single line of OCaml, and you can learn algorithm with it as well
